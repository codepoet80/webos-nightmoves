Night Moves is a utility along the lines of f.lux or or Night Panel on other OSes -- save that it doesn't actually change color temperature, since there's no API for that in webOS. What it does instead is changes the screen brightness and volume (both System and Ringtone) on a schedule that you set.

You can use it to dim the screen and lower the volume at bed time, and increase them again in the morning.

At the moment it works well on the Pre3, poorly on the Touchpad, and is un-tested on other devices (although it theoretically should work, since it uses official APIs.)
